Portfolio website react rebuild of my [previous portfolio website.](https://dotslashjb.netlify.app)

Live version:

https://jbdev.io

Website includes about page, projects section with individual project posts and contact page. Light and dark mode toggle and animation on logo. 

Responsive design across devices. 

Built with Reactjs and vanilla CSS. 
- On reflection, Tailwind would have been better suited for the purpose and function of easily integrating of ongoing style changes made to the website over time.

To do:

- [ ] 404 page redirect to home
- [ ] Initial loading animation tweaks.
- [ ] Implement emailJS contact form.
